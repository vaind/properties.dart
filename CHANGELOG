0.4.0 - 27-02-2013

- the method everyKey() is now every() and may optionally filter on property's value too;
- added AddEvent? class, extending PropertiesEvent?, having key and value properties set to the corresponding values of the newly added property;
- add key has now an additional optional parameter to decide whether to overwrite existing property, if any;
- improved doc and tests.


0.3.0 - 20-02-2013

- addFromXXX methods have been renamed into mergeXXX, giving the user the capability to choose whether to overwrite or keep existing matching properties:

// dinamically merge properties from input Properties object into the 
// current instance's properties, without overwriting eventually existing properties
p.merge(anotherPropertiesInstance, false);

// dinamically merge properties from input JSON object into the 
// current instance's properties, overwriting existing ones
p.mergeJSON('{"test.key.3":"value 3","test.key.4":"value 4"}', true);

- added very simple event management: now one may listen to "add property" events triggered when a new property is added at runtime

p.onAdd.listen((PropertiesEvent e) => print("Received: " + e.type));


0.2.0 - 17-02-2013

Added some tools to work with JSON objects too

// create a new instance from a JSON map
Properties p = new Properties.fromJSON(jsonMap);

// export the (whole) content as a JSON map
p.toJSON(prefix:"keyprefix", suffix:"keysuffix");

// dinamically add new properties to the current instance from JSON
p.addFromJSON('{"test.key.3":"value 3","test.key.4":"value 4"}');


0.1.0 - 16-02-2013

First release: basic tools, support for plain old properties files.
